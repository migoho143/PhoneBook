		<h1>Welcome to my Poonbook</h1>
		This poonbook also known as a telephone book, telephone address book phonebook is a listing of <br>
		phonebook subscribers in a geographical area or subscribers to services provided by the oraganization<br> 
		that publishes the directory. its purpose is to allow the phonebook email of a subscriber identifiesd by<br>
		name and address to be found.<br>
		<br>
		The advent of the internet and smartphones in the 21st century greatly reduced the need of a paper<br>
	    poonbook. Some communities, such as Seattle and San Francisco, sought to ban their unsolicited<br>
		distribution as wasted unwanted and harmful to the environment.<br><br>
		
		Subscriber names are generally listed in alphabetical order. together with their email. in principle<br>
		every subscriber in the geographical coverage area is listed, but subscribers may request the exclusion<br>
		of their number from the directory, often for a fee: thier email is then said to be unlisted, ex directory<br>
		private or private email, or non published.
